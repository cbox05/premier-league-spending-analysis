Premier League Spending vs Performance Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between transfer spending and league performance
in the English Premier League across five seasons (2018–19 to 2022–23).

Objectives

Evaluate whether financial investment drives competitive success

Quantify the strength of the relationship between spending and points

Identify clubs that overperform relative to spending

Methods

Match-level aggregation to season-level performance

Financial data cleaning and normalization

Correlation analysis

Linear regression modeling

Residual-based efficiency evaluation

Key Results

Spending explains only ~5–6% of the variation in league points.

Net spending shows negligible predictive power.

Several clubs significantly outperformed spending-based expectations.

Financial investment alone does not determine league success.
